      <h2>Traveling Around Tunisia</h2>

      <h3>Accommodation in Nabeul</h3>
      <p>
        We strongly recommend booking <strong>Hotel Imen in Nabeul</strong>. The prices are as follows:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Single Room: 60 dinars / night</li>
        <li>Double Room: 80 dinars / night (for 2 people)</li>
        <li>Triple Room: 100 dinars / night (for 3 people)</li>
        <li>Quadruple Room: 120 dinars / day (for 4 people)</li>
        <li>Apartment: starting 200 dinars / night (includes a kitchen)</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        When you book this place, please mention in your email that you are part of the “Noor Wedding” so hopefully you get a discount.
        Additionally, in this hotel, you only get a bed, no breakfast or optional breakfast. However, right underneath is Noorjahan’s favorite cafe: Brooks! They serve amazing brunches, breakfast menus, and cakes!
      </p>

      <h3>Food</h3>
      <p>
        Food prices vary between 7 to 70 dinars per meal depending on where you want to eat. Nabeul has plenty of restaurants and cafes. It is very common for 2 people to get brunch for up to 45 dinars, usually less.
        If you are allergic to anything, we recommend preparing your meals at Noorjahan’s house. If you are vegan, please know that most Tunisian restaurants do not know what vegan is and you’ll have to explain it.
        You’ll also have to remind restaurants of your dietary restrictions when ordering.
      </p>

      <h3>Water</h3>
      <p>
        Please always drink mineral or bottled water. Also be aware of your water consumption when showering since Tunisia is currently going through a drought.
      </p>

      <p>
        It’s good to know some French phrases (or Arabic!) to get around. However, most young people speak English relatively well.
      </p>

      <h3>Always Have Cash!</h3>
      <p>
        Stores sometimes accept cards, but sometimes the machine does not work or there is a minimum purchase required to pay by card. It’s safest to carry cash.
      </p>

      <h3>Getting to Nabeul from Tunis/Airport</h3>
      <p>
        You can take the bus (5.3 dinars) or a louage (6.6 dinars) to Nabeul from Tunis depending on the time of day. There are no buses or louages running between 19:00 and 05:00.
        You will need to take a taxi from the airport to the bus or louage station (called Bab Alioua). We recommend using Bolt when ordering the taxi so you get a fixed price.
      </p>
      <p>
        You can also hire a private taxi, which costs around 150 dinars, depending on the time of arrival. If you would like to do this, please reach out via the email address.
        Another option is renting a car from the airport, which costs between 120 and 250 dinars per day, depending on the car.
      </p>
      <p>
        Unfortunately, NJ does not have a car to pick you up from Tunis. However, we can coordinate a time for when most people are arriving and leave for Nabeul together via louage or bus.
        Additionally, if you want to sightsee around Tunis while staying in Nabeul, you can easily take a bus or louage back to Tunis, as it is very accessible.
      </p>

      <h3>Getting Around and Sightseeing in Tunisia</h3>
      <p>
        If there are cities you would like to visit, you will most likely find a bus or louage that goes there. The trains are not reliable at all. 
        If there are specific places you want to visit, please reach out to Noorjahan via WhatsApp for planning assistance.
      </p>
      <p>
        Cities that are worth visiting if you have extra days include: <strong>Tunis</strong> (Sidi Bou Said, Medina, Carthage, Downtown Tunis), <strong>El Djem</strong>, <strong>Sousse</strong>, and <strong>Monastir</strong>.
        Museums can sometimes be free on special days (e.g., the first Sunday of the month). Foreigners are often charged more than Tunisians, so add a few extra dinars to your budget just in case.
      </p>

      <h3>Safety</h3>
      <p>
        Please know that everyone is welcome at Our Wedding! We love our friends as you are, and we are thankful you’re in our lives. However, not everyone in Tunisia is welcoming right now due to political tension.
      </p>
      <p>
        Tunisia has recorded several racist incidents, primarily targeting Black people. Additionally, LGBTQA+ rights are very underdeveloped; LGBTQA+ relations are still criminalized, and cross-dressing is illegal.
        Please also be aware that by Tunisian law, <strong>all wedding venues must have police presence</strong> (in civilian clothes) to ensure guest safety.
      </p>
      <p>
        Tunisia is generally safe, except late at night (after 20:00) or very early in the morning (05:00–07:00) if you are walking alone. However, if you are walking in pairs, it is typically very safe regardless of the time.
      </p>

      <h3>Little Cultural Things</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Say things like “aayshek” (thank you) and “aayshek” (please) — these go a long way!</li>
        <li>Tunisians stare a LOT. Don’t be alarmed; it’s fairly common.</li>
        <li>In big cities, you can wear whatever you want. If you go to smaller towns, it’s best to wear something that covers your knees.</li>
      </ul>
